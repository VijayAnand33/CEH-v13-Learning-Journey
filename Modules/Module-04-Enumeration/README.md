## Overview

Enumeration is the process of actively extracting detailed information from target systems after identifying live hosts, open ports, services, and operating systems during the reconnaissance and scanning phases. Unlike passive information gathering, enumeration establishes active connections with target services to retrieve valuable information such as usernames, user groups, machine names, shared resources, domain details, SNMP information, and service configurations. The information gathered during enumeration enables penetration testers to identify potential attack vectors, privilege escalation opportunities, and security weaknesses that may be exploited during later stages of a penetration test.

# Lab 1: Perform NetBIOS Enumeration

## Objective

To perform NetBIOS enumeration using Windows command-line utilities and extract information such as NetBIOS names, machine details, and shared network resources from a remote Windows system.

## Background

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a legacy networking protocol that enables communication between computers on a local network. Although modern Windows environments primarily rely on DNS and Active Directory, NetBIOS is still enabled in many systems for compatibility purposes. Enumerating NetBIOS information can reveal computer names, registered services, shared resources, and other network details that assist penetration testers in understanding the target environment.

Windows provides built-in command-line utilities such as **nbtstat** and **net use** to query NetBIOS information and enumerate shared network resources without requiring additional software.

---

## Task 1: Perform NetBIOS Enumeration using Windows Command-Line Utilities

### Tools Used

- [Windows Command-Line Utilities](../../Tools/Windows-Command-Line-Utilities.md)

### Activity Performed

Windows command-line utilities were used to enumerate NetBIOS information from the target Windows 11 system. The `nbtstat -a` command queried the remote host and displayed its NetBIOS name table, revealing the computer name, registered NetBIOS services, and MAC address. The `net use` command was then executed to display existing network connections and shared resources available on the system.

These built-in utilities demonstrated how valuable reconnaissance information can be gathered without installing third-party enumeration tools.

### Observations

- Successfully enumerated the NetBIOS name table of the target system.
- Identified the target computer name and registered NetBIOS services.
- Enumerated existing network connections and shared resources.
- Observed that Windows built-in utilities provide valuable enumeration capabilities during reconnaissance.

The information gathered provides valuable insight into the target environment and supports subsequent enumeration and exploitation activities.

# Lab 2: Perform SNMP Enumeration

## Objective

To perform SNMP enumeration using SnmpWalk and retrieve management information, system details, and network configuration data from a target system.

## Background

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely used to monitor and manage network devices such as routers, switches, servers, and printers. Devices running SNMP expose management information through a hierarchical structure of Object Identifiers (OIDs). If weak or default community strings are configured, attackers can enumerate sensitive information including system details, network interfaces, running services, routing information, and device configurations.

SnmpWalk is a command-line utility that queries SNMP-enabled devices by traversing the Management Information Base (MIB) tree and retrieving all accessible OIDs.

---

## Task 1: Perform SNMP Enumeration using SnmpWalk

### Tools Used

- [SnmpWalk](../../Tools/SnmpWalk.md)

### Activity Performed

SnmpWalk was used to enumerate SNMP information from the target Windows Server 2022 system. Enumeration was performed using both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c with the default **public** community string. The tool queried the Management Information Base (MIB) and retrieved accessible Object Identifiers (OIDs), exposing valuable information about the target system, including device configuration, system information, network parameters, and management data.

The results demonstrated how improperly secured SNMP services can disclose sensitive information that may assist attackers during reconnaissance.

### Observations

- Successfully connected to the target using the default SNMP community string.
- Retrieved numerous Object Identifiers (OIDs) from the target system.
- Enumerated system information and network management data.
- Observed that misconfigured SNMP services can expose sensitive information useful during reconnaissance.

### Figures

![SNMP Enumeration](Images/Lab2-SNMP-Enumeration.png)

**Figure 2.1:** SnmpWalk enumerated the target system by traversing the Management Information Base (MIB), revealing accessible Object Identifiers (OIDs) and associated system information.

### Learning Outcome

This task demonstrated how SNMP enumeration can reveal valuable management information from network devices when default or weak community strings are configured. Properly securing SNMP services is essential to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive network information.

The retrieved management information provides valuable intelligence during reconnaissance and highlights the importance of securing SNMP services by using strong community strings and restricting unauthorized access.

# Lab 3: Perform LDAP Enumeration

## Objective

To perform LDAP enumeration using Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) and retrieve information about the Active Directory structure, domain objects, and user account attributes.

## Background

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol used to access and manage directory services such as Microsoft Active Directory. LDAP stores information about users, groups, computers, organizational units, and other network resources in a hierarchical directory structure. Enumerating LDAP provides penetration testers with valuable information about the domain environment, including user accounts, group memberships, computer objects, and directory configurations.

Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is a graphical tool that enables administrators and security professionals to browse, search, and inspect Active Directory objects without using native Windows administration consoles.

Enumerating directory objects and user attributes enables penetration testers to better understand the domain architecture and identify information that may support subsequent attack phases.

# Lab 4: Perform NFS Enumeration

## Objective

To perform Network File System (NFS) enumeration using SuperEnum and RPCScan to identify RPC services, NFS shares, and network resources exposed by the target system.

## Background

Network File System (NFS) enables systems to share files and directories across a network. Before accessing shared resources, attackers often enumerate NFS services to identify exported directories, RPC services, mount points, and file-sharing configurations. Since NFS relies on Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services, both RPC enumeration and NFS enumeration are commonly performed together to identify accessible network resources.

SuperEnum automates the enumeration of common network services, while RPCScan focuses specifically on discovering RPC services and NFS-related information.

---

## Task 1: Perform NFS Enumeration using RPCScan and SuperEnum

### Tools Used

- [SuperEnum](../../Tools/SuperEnum.md)
- [RPCScan](../../Tools/RPCScan.md)

### Activity Performed

NFS enumeration was performed against the target Windows Server 2019 system after confirming that the NFS service was available. SuperEnum was used to scan the target host and identify open services, including the NFS service running on TCP port 2049. The enumeration results confirmed that the NFS service was accessible along with other exposed network services.

RPCScan was then used to enumerate Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services associated with the target. The tool identified the RPC portmapper information and verified that the NFS service was active, providing additional insight into the services exposed by the target system.

### Observations

- Successfully identified the NFS service running on TCP port 2049.
- Enumerated exposed network services using SuperEnum.
- Retrieved RPC information associated with the target host.
- Verified that the NFS service was accessible through RPC enumeration.
- Observed that exposed NFS services can disclose valuable information during reconnaissance.

# Lab 5: Perform DNS Enumeration

## Objective

To perform DNS enumeration using Windows and Linux command-line utilities to retrieve DNS information and assess whether the target DNS server permits zone transfers.

## Background

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses and stores important information about network infrastructure. DNS enumeration enables penetration testers to identify authoritative name servers, mail servers, Start of Authority (SOA) records, and other DNS information that helps map a target's network.

A DNS zone transfer (AXFR) is used to replicate DNS records between primary and secondary DNS servers. If improperly configured, attackers may retrieve the entire DNS zone database, exposing internal hosts and network information that can assist in further attacks.

---

## Task 1: Perform DNS Enumeration using Zone Transfer

### Tools Used

- [Windows Command-Line Utilities](../../Tools/Windows-Command-Line-Utilities.md)

### Activity Performed

Windows and Linux command-line utilities were used to perform DNS enumeration on the target domain. The **`dig`** utility on the Parrot Security machine was used to identify the authoritative DNS name servers and attempt a DNS zone transfer (AXFR). On the Windows system, the **`nslookup`** utility was used to retrieve the Start of Authority (SOA) record and verify whether the target DNS server permitted zone transfers.

The enumeration successfully retrieved DNS server information, while the zone transfer request was refused by the target DNS server, demonstrating that unauthorized zone transfers were disabled.

### Observations

- Successfully identified the authoritative DNS name servers for the target domain.
- Retrieved Start of Authority (SOA) information for the target domain.
- Attempted a DNS zone transfer (AXFR) against the target DNS server.
- Observed that the target server refused unauthorized zone transfer requests.
- Confirmed that properly configured DNS servers restrict zone transfers to authorized secondary servers.

---

## Defensive Perspective

Enumeration can expose valuable information that attackers may leverage to compromise an organization's infrastructure. Organizations should minimize information disclosure by disabling unnecessary services, restricting anonymous access, securing SNMP with strong community strings or SNMPv3, preventing unauthorized DNS zone transfers, disabling SMTP user enumeration and open relay configurations, limiting access to shared resources, and enforcing the principle of least privilege. Regular security audits, service hardening, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring help reduce the attack surface exposed during the enumeration phase.

## My Reflection

This module strengthened my understanding of enumeration as the bridge between reconnaissance and exploitation. Rather than simply identifying live hosts and open ports, enumeration revealed detailed information about users, services, operating systems, network resources, and configurations that could later be leveraged during vulnerability assessments or exploitation. Working with both traditional enumeration tools and AI-assisted workflows demonstrated how automation can improve efficiency while reinforcing the importance of securing exposed services, restricting unnecessary information disclosure, and implementing proper security controls to reduce an organization's attack surface.
