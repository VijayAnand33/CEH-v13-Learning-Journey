# Module Summary

This module introduces SQL Injection (SQLi), one of the most critical and widely exploited vulnerabilities affecting database-driven web applications. Throughout this module, I learned how attackers exploit insecure SQL queries, how ethical hackers identify and verify SQL Injection vulnerabilities, and how these vulnerabilities can be exploited to enumerate databases, extract sensitive information, and gain deeper access to vulnerable systems.

The practical labs covered authenticated SQL Injection attacks against Microsoft SQL Server using sqlmap, SQL Injection vulnerability detection using OWASP ZAP, and AI-assisted SQL Injection testing using ShellGPT.

Rather than focusing only on executing commands, this documentation explains the concepts, attack methodology, tools used, and the reasoning behind each stage of the penetration testing process.

---

# Overview

SQL Injection is a code injection vulnerability that occurs when user-supplied input is improperly validated and incorporated directly into SQL queries. Successful SQL Injection attacks can allow attackers to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information, modify database contents, or execute operating system commands depending on the database configuration.

This module demonstrates how penetration testers identify SQL Injection vulnerabilities, verify their existence, enumerate backend databases, extract sensitive information, and understand the impact of insecure database interactions. It also covers automated vulnerability detection and AI-assisted penetration testing techniques using modern security tools.

Throughout the practical labs, I learned not only how to perform SQL Injection attacks, but also why these vulnerabilities exist and the defensive mechanisms developers should implement to prevent them.

# Lab 1 - Perform SQL Injection Attacks

## Objective

To understand how SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited against a Microsoft SQL Server-backed web application using sqlmap to enumerate databases, extract sensitive information, and obtain operating system command execution.

---

## Background

SQL Injection occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input before incorporating it into SQL queries. Attackers can exploit this weakness to manipulate database queries, retrieve confidential information, bypass authentication mechanisms, or even execute operating system commands depending on the database configuration.

This lab demonstrates the complete SQL Injection attack lifecycle, beginning with an authenticated web session, followed by vulnerability verification, database enumeration, credential extraction, and operating system shell access using sqlmap.

---

## Task 1 - Perform SQL Injection Against MSSQL using sqlmap

### Tools Used

- [sqlmap](../../Tools/sqlmap.md)

---

### Activity Performed

An authenticated session was first established by logging into the vulnerable web application using valid user credentials. The session cookie obtained from the browser was supplied to sqlmap together with the vulnerable profile URL, allowing the tool to perform SQL Injection testing within the authenticated session.

sqlmap automatically identified the SQL Injection vulnerability, fingerprinted the backend Microsoft SQL Server database, enumerated all available databases, selected the target MovieScope database, extracted information from the `user_login` table, and successfully obtained operating system shell access through the vulnerable database server.

---

### Observations

- Successfully authenticated to the vulnerable application.
- Reused the authenticated session cookie during testing.
- SQL Injection vulnerability was automatically detected.
- Backend database identified as Microsoft SQL Server.
- Database enumeration completed successfully.
- Sensitive user information was extracted from the database.
- Operating system shell access was successfully obtained.

## Overall Learning Outcome

This lab demonstrated the complete lifecycle of an authenticated SQL Injection attack. By exploiting insecure SQL queries, I learned how attackers enumerate databases, retrieve sensitive information, and escalate access beyond the database server. I also understood why proper input validation, parameterized queries, and least-privilege database configurations are essential for preventing SQL Injection attacks.

# Lab 2 - Detect SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Using OWASP ZAP

## Objective

To understand how OWASP ZAP detects SQL Injection vulnerabilities by analyzing web application requests and responses through automated security scanning.

---

## Background

Before exploiting a vulnerability, penetration testers must first identify and verify its existence. Automated vulnerability scanners such as OWASP ZAP assist security professionals by detecting common web application vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure HTTP headers, and authentication weaknesses.

This lab demonstrates how OWASP ZAP performs automated security assessments to identify SQL Injection vulnerabilities that may require further manual verification and exploitation.

---

## Task 1 - Detect SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Using OWASP ZAP

### Tools Used

- [OWASP ZAP](../../Tools/OWASP-ZAP.md)

---

### Activity Performed

The target web application was scanned using OWASP ZAP after performing reconnaissance and spidering. Once the scan completed, the generated security alerts were reviewed to identify SQL Injection findings.

The vulnerability details provided by OWASP ZAP were analyzed to understand the affected parameter, associated risk level, confidence level, and potential security impact. The identified SQL Injection vulnerability confirmed that the application was susceptible to database injection attacks and required further assessment.

---

### Observations

- Automated vulnerability scan completed successfully.
- SQL Injection vulnerability was detected.
- Vulnerable request parameter was identified.
- Risk and confidence levels were provided by OWASP ZAP.
- The vulnerability could be further verified using exploitation tools such as sqlmap.

# Lab 3 - Perform SQL Injection Using ShellGPT

## Objective

To understand how AI-assisted tools such as ShellGPT can simplify SQL Injection testing by generating sqlmap commands from natural language prompts and assisting penetration testers during security assessments.

---

## Background

Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being integrated into penetration testing workflows to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort. Rather than manually constructing complex commands, penetration testers can describe their objective in natural language and allow AI assistants to generate appropriate commands based on the testing requirements.

This lab demonstrates how ShellGPT can be used to generate sqlmap commands for SQL Injection testing against an authenticated web application.

---

## Task 1 - Perform SQL Injection Using ShellGPT

### Tools Used

- [ShellGPT](../../Tools/ShellGPT.md)
- [sqlmap](../../Tools/sqlmap.md)

---

### Activity Performed

A natural language prompt describing the SQL Injection objective was provided to ShellGPT. The prompt included the target URL, authentication cookie, and the requirement to enumerate the MovieScope database.

ShellGPT analyzed the request and automatically generated the appropriate sqlmap command. The generated command was then executed to perform SQL Injection testing against the authenticated target application, demonstrating how AI can assist penetration testers by reducing the effort required to construct complex security testing commands.

---

### Observations

- AI successfully interpreted the natural language request.
- ShellGPT generated the appropriate sqlmap command.
- Authentication cookies were included automatically in the generated command.
- SQL Injection testing became faster and more efficient.
- AI-assisted command generation reduced manual command construction.
