After generating the APK, it was delivered to the target Android device and installed. Once executed, the malicious application established a remote session with the attacker's machine, allowing device information to be collected and sensitive data, including SMS messages, to be extracted from the compromised device.

---

### Observations

- Generated a malicious Android APK.
- Started the AndroRAT listener.
- Installed the malicious application on the target device.

# Defensive Perspective

Android devices should be protected by disabling ADB debugging when not required, restricting ADB over network connections, installing applications only from trusted sources, and keeping the operating system and applications up to date. Organizations should deploy mobile security solutions, perform regular malware scans, enforce mobile device management (MDM) policies, and educate users about the risks of installing untrusted APK files. These practices significantly reduce the risk of malware infections and unauthorized device access.
