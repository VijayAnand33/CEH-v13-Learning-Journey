# Overview

After completing the footprinting and reconnaissance phase, the next step in a penetration test is to actively validate the collected information through network scanning. Unlike passive reconnaissance, scanning directly interacts with target systems to determine which hosts are online, identify open ports, detect running services, fingerprint operating systems, and uncover potential vulnerabilities.

This module explored a variety of network scanning techniques using industry-standard tools. It also covered firewall and IDS evasion methods, demonstrating how different scanning approaches can bypass security controls while emphasizing the importance of defensive monitoring. Additionally, the module introduced AI-assisted scanning with ShellGPT, illustrating how artificial intelligence can simplify command generation and improve the efficiency of reconnaissance activities.

# Lab 1: Perform Host Discovery

## Objective

To identify active hosts within a target network using multiple Nmap host discovery techniques and understand how different discovery methods determine host availability before subsequent network scanning activities.

---

## Background

Host discovery is the first stage of active network scanning. After gathering target information during reconnaissance, penetration testers must identify which systems are currently online before performing port scanning or service enumeration. Nmap provides several host discovery techniques that leverage different network protocols, allowing live hosts to be detected even when certain packet types are restricted by firewalls or security devices.

By comparing multiple discovery methods, ethical hackers can improve reconnaissance accuracy, validate target availability, and identify responsive systems under various network conditions before conducting deeper security assessments.

---

## Task 1: Perform Host Discovery using Nmap

### Tools Used

- [Nmap](../../Tools/Nmap.md)

---

### Activity Performed

Nmap was used to perform host discovery against the target network using multiple scanning techniques, including ARP Ping Scan, UDP Ping Scan, ICMP Echo Ping Scan, ICMP Echo Ping Sweep, and ICMP Timestamp Ping Scan. Each technique transmitted a different type of probe packet to determine whether the target system was active and reachable.

The ARP Ping Scan successfully identified the target host within the local network by sending ARP requests. ICMP-based discovery techniques verified host availability through Echo and Timestamp requests, while the ICMP Echo Ping Sweep discovered multiple active systems across the specified IP address range. These techniques demonstrated how different network protocols can be leveraged to identify live hosts depending on network topology, protocol support, and security configurations.

The host discovery results established the foundation for subsequent port scanning, service detection, operating system fingerprinting, and vulnerability assessment activities performed in later stages of the network scanning process.

---

### Observations

- Successfully identified the Windows Server 2022 target host (10.10.1.22) as active within the target network.
- Verified host availability using multiple Nmap host discovery techniques.
- Discovered multiple live systems within the specified IP address range using an ICMP Echo Ping Sweep.
- Observed that different host discovery techniques rely on different network protocols and response types.
- Demonstrated that alternative discovery methods can be used when specific probe packets are filtered or restricted by firewalls and network security devices.

# Lab 2: Perform Port and Service Discovery

## Objective

To identify open ports, running services, service versions, and operating system information on target hosts using various Nmap scanning techniques. This lab demonstrated how different scan types provide unique insights into a target's attack surface while also highlighting the effects of firewall filtering on scan results.

---

## Background

After identifying active hosts, the next phase of network scanning is to enumerate the services exposed by those systems. Port and service discovery helps penetration testers determine which applications are accessible over the network, identify their versions, and gather operating system information that may reveal potential vulnerabilities. Nmap offers multiple scanning techniques that vary in stealth, accuracy, and interaction with security devices, making it one of the most versatile tools for network enumeration.

Understanding the strengths and limitations of each scan type enables ethical hackers to select the most appropriate technique based on the target environment while minimizing detection.

# Lab 4: Scan beyond IDS and Firewall

## Objective

To perform network scanning while bypassing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewall mechanisms using various Nmap evasion techniques. This lab demonstrated how packet fragmentation, source port manipulation, MTU modification, and IP address decoys can reduce the effectiveness of network filtering and detection.

---

## Background

Modern networks commonly deploy firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor, filter, and block suspicious network traffic. Traditional port scanning techniques may be detected or restricted by these security controls, making reconnaissance more difficult. Nmap provides several evasion mechanisms that alter packet characteristics or disguise the source of scanning traffic to reduce the likelihood of detection.

Understanding these techniques enables penetration testers to evaluate the effectiveness of defensive controls while helping security professionals identify weaknesses in firewall and IDS configurations.

---

## Task 1: Scan beyond IDS/Firewall using Various Evasion Techniques

### Tools Used

- [Nmap](../../Tools/Nmap.md)
- [Wireshark](../../Tools/Wireshark.md)

---

### Activity Performed

Nmap was used to perform network scans against the target Windows 11 system while applying multiple IDS and firewall evasion techniques. Packet fragmentation was used to divide probe packets into smaller fragments, reducing the likelihood of inspection by poorly configured security devices. Source port manipulation was then performed by sending scan traffic from a trusted source port commonly permitted by firewall rules.

Additional evasion methods included modifying the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to transmit smaller packets and using IP address decoys to conceal the true origin of the scan among multiple spoofed addresses. Throughout the assessment, Wireshark captured the network traffic on the target system, allowing each evasion technique to be analyzed and verified.

These techniques demonstrated how changes to packet structure and source information can influence the effectiveness of network security controls while still allowing reconnaissance activities to succeed.

---

### Observations

- Successfully performed network scanning despite Windows Defender Firewall being enabled.
- Verified that fragmented packets reached the target system.
- Observed packet fragmentation within captured network traffic using Wireshark.
- Confirmed that source port manipulation used TCP port 80 during scanning.
- Observed multiple spoofed source IP addresses generated during the decoy scan.

# Defensive Perspective

Network scanning is one of the earliest indicators of reconnaissance activity against an organization's infrastructure. Detecting and responding to unauthorized scanning attempts allows defenders to identify potential attackers before exploitation begins. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and network monitoring solutions should be configured to detect abnormal scanning patterns, fragmented packets, spoofed source addresses, and unusual protocol usage.

Organizations should also minimize their attack surface by disabling unnecessary services, restricting access to sensitive ports, applying appropriate firewall rules, and regularly auditing exposed systems. Continuous network monitoring, vulnerability management, and timely patching significantly reduce the risk of attackers successfully leveraging information gathered during the scanning phase.

# My Reflection

This module demonstrated that effective penetration testing begins with thorough reconnaissance rather than immediate exploitation. Through the various Nmap scanning techniques, I learned how different scan types contribute unique information about a target environment, ranging from identifying live hosts and open ports to discovering running services, operating systems, and firewall behavior. Comparing these techniques also highlighted how network security controls influence scan results and why multiple scanning methods are often required to build a complete picture of the target.

The Metasploit and ShellGPT labs further demonstrated how modern penetration testing combines traditional security tools with automation and AI-assisted workflows to improve efficiency while maintaining analytical decision-making. Overall, this module reinforced the importance of accurate network reconnaissance as the foundation for vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and every subsequent phase of a penetration test.
