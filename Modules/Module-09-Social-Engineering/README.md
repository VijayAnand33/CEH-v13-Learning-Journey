# Module Summary

This module explores how attackers exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to compromise organizations. It demonstrates practical social engineering techniques such as credential harvesting, phishing detection, and AI-assisted phishing email generation. The module also highlights defensive strategies that help organizations recognize, prevent, and respond to social engineering attacks.

---

# Overview

Social engineering is the practice of manipulating individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, social engineering targets human behavior through deception, persuasion, and impersonation. Common techniques include phishing emails, fake websites, pretexting, and credential harvesting.

This module provides practical experience with social engineering assessment tools, phishing detection techniques, and AI-assisted phishing content generation while emphasizing the importance of security awareness and user education.

# Lab 1: Perform Social Engineering using Various Techniques

## Objective

Perform a social engineering assessment by creating a credential harvesting attack using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET). This lab demonstrates how attackers clone legitimate websites, distribute phishing emails, and capture user credentials through deceptive web pages.

## Background

Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information. Credential harvesting is one of the most common phishing techniques, where attackers clone legitimate websites and trick victims into submitting usernames and passwords. Ethical hackers use controlled social engineering assessments to evaluate employee awareness and identify weaknesses in organizational security training.

---

## Task 1: Sniff Credentials using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

### Tools Used

- [Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)](../../Tools/Social-Engineer-Toolkit-SET.md)

---

### Activity Performed

The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) was used to clone a legitimate website and launch a credential harvester. A phishing email containing a disguised hyperlink was then created and sent to a target user. When the victim accessed the cloned website and entered their credentials, SET successfully captured the submitted username and password.

---

### Observations

- Successfully launched the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET).
- Configured the Credential Harvester attack using the Site Cloner method.
- Cloned the target website to create a realistic phishing page.
- Crafted a phishing email containing a disguised malicious hyperlink.
- Simulated a victim accessing the cloned login page.
- Captured the victim's submitted credentials in plaintext through SET.

## Overall Learning Outcome

This lab demonstrated how credential harvesting attacks are performed using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET). By cloning a legitimate website, delivering a phishing email, and capturing user credentials, it illustrated how attackers exploit human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. The exercise reinforced the importance of phishing awareness, URL verification, multi-factor authentication, and continuous user education to defend against social engineering attacks.

# Lab 2: Detect a Phishing Attack

## Objective

Detect phishing websites using the Netcraft browser extension. This lab demonstrates how security professionals can identify malicious websites, analyze website reputation, and recognize phishing indicators before interacting with suspicious web pages.

---

## Background

Phishing attacks deceive users into revealing sensitive information by impersonating legitimate websites and organizations. Modern anti-phishing tools help users evaluate website reputation, identify suspicious domains, and block access to known phishing sites. Ethical hackers use these tools to assess organizational awareness and educate users on recognizing phishing attempts before credentials or sensitive information are compromised.

---

## Task 1: Detect Phishing using Netcraft

### Tools Used

- [Netcraft](../../Tools/Netcraft.md)

---

### Activity Performed

The Netcraft browser extension was installed and configured to analyze website reputation and detect phishing attempts. A legitimate website was inspected to review its security information, followed by visiting a known phishing website to observe how Netcraft automatically identified and blocked the malicious page.

---

### Observations

- Successfully installed the Netcraft browser extension.
- Verified the extension was active within the web browser.
- Reviewed the security profile of a legitimate website.
- Examined website reputation information, including hosting and SSL/TLS details.
- Detected and blocked a known phishing website.
- Observed Netcraft's phishing warning before accessing the malicious page.
