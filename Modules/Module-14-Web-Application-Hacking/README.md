# Labs Covered

## Lab 1 - Footprint the Web Infrastructure

### Objective

To understand how web application reconnaissance is performed to identify the target application's infrastructure, technologies, services, directories, and potential attack surface before attempting any exploitation.

---

### Background

Reconnaissance is the first phase of a web application penetration test. Before attempting to exploit a web application, a penetration tester must understand how the application is built, which services are running, what technologies are being used, and whether any potential vulnerabilities exist. Collecting this information helps build an attack strategy and reduces unnecessary guessing during later stages of the assessment.

---

### Task 1 - Perform Web Application Reconnaissance using Nmap and Telnet

#### Tools Used

- [Nmap](../../Tools/Nmap.md)
- [Telnet](../../Tools/Telnet.md)

#### Activity Performed

Performed reconnaissance on the target web application using **Nmap** and **Telnet**. Nmap was used to identify open ports, discover running services, detect service versions, and gather information about the target web server. Telnet was then used to establish a manual connection to the web server over HTTP (port 80) and retrieve HTTP response headers through banner grabbing.

#### Purpose

The objective of this task was to collect information about the target web application's infrastructure before attempting any exploitation. Identifying exposed services, server software, technologies, and version information helps a penetration tester understand the target environment and identify potential attack vectors for subsequent security assessments.

#### Observations

- Identified the target's open ports and the services running on them.
- Detected the web server software and service version using Nmap.
- Retrieved HTTP response headers through Telnet, revealing information about the web server and underlying technologies.
- Gathered reconnaissance data that can be used to identify known vulnerabilities and plan further testing activities.

#### Scan Result

# My Reflection

This module significantly improved my understanding of web application penetration testing by connecting theoretical concepts with practical implementation. Rather than focusing solely on executing commands, I learned the reasoning behind each stage of the assessment process—from reconnaissance and vulnerability identification to controlled exploitation and AI-assisted testing.

One of the most valuable lessons from this module was understanding that penetration testing is a structured methodology rather than a collection of tools or commands. Every activity performed during the labs had a specific objective and contributed to building a complete picture of the target application's security posture.

Completing this module also reinforced the importance of documenting findings, validating automated results, and continuously learning the technologies behind the tools used during security assessments.
