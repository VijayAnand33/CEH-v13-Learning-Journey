# Module Summary

This module explores Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, demonstrating how attackers overwhelm systems and network services to make them unavailable to legitimate users. Through practical labs, the module covers multiple flooding techniques, botnet-based attacks, and defensive mechanisms used to detect, analyze, and mitigate DoS and DDoS attacks in enterprise environments.

---

# Overview

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks aim to exhaust a target system's resources by flooding it with excessive requests or malformed traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing services. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks amplify this impact by coordinating multiple compromised systems to launch large-scale attacks simultaneously.

This module provides hands-on experience in performing controlled DoS and DDoS attacks using various tools, analyzing attack traffic, and implementing defensive measures to detect and mitigate these attacks while maintaining network availability.

# Lab 1: Perform DoS and DDoS Attacks using Various Techniques

## Objective

Perform controlled DoS and DDoS attacks using multiple attack techniques to understand how resource exhaustion affects system availability. This lab demonstrates TCP flooding, distributed flooding, botnet-based attacks, and the resulting impact on target system performance.

---

## Background

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks exhaust the resources of a target system by flooding it with excessive traffic, making services unavailable to legitimate users. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks amplify this impact by coordinating multiple compromised systems to simultaneously attack the same target. Ethical hackers perform controlled DoS and DDoS simulations to evaluate the resilience of network infrastructure and verify the effectiveness of defensive controls.

# Lab 2: Detect and Protect Against DoS and DDoS Attacks

## Objective

Detect and mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using Anti DDoS Guardian. This lab demonstrates how security professionals can monitor incoming network traffic, identify malicious hosts, analyze attack sessions, and block attackers to protect network resources.

---

## Background

DoS and DDoS attacks generate excessive malicious traffic that overwhelms system resources and disrupts legitimate services. Effective defense requires continuous traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and rapid mitigation. Anti DDoS Guardian provides real-time monitoring and protection by analyzing incoming connections, identifying suspicious traffic, and allowing administrators to block malicious IP addresses before they impact service availability.

### Activity Performed

Anti DDoS Guardian was installed and configured on the Windows 11 target machine to monitor network traffic in real time. LOIC was then configured on two separate attacker machines to generate a UDP flooding attack against the target. Anti DDoS Guardian detected the abnormal traffic, displayed the malicious sessions, and was used to block the attacking IP addresses.

---

### Observations

# Defensive Perspective

Denial-of-Service attacks primarily target service availability by exhausting system or network resources. Organizations should implement layered DDoS protection using traffic filtering, rate limiting, intrusion detection and prevention systems, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and dedicated DDoS mitigation services. Continuous network monitoring, behavioral traffic analysis, IP reputation filtering, and rapid incident response procedures enable security teams to identify abnormal traffic patterns early and minimize the operational impact of DoS and DDoS attacks.
